# Stack Space
Welcome to StackSpace, a challenging and addictive web game that will test your timing and stacking skills. In this game, your objective is simple: stack blocks by clicking the space bar at the right moment. But be careful, if you fail to stack a block properly, it's game over!

## How to Play

1.  **Launch the Game:** Open the game in your web browser. You can play it on your computer, tablet, or smartphone.
2.  **Get Ready:** Once the game starts, blocks will begin descending from the top of the screen.
3.  **Stack the Blocks:** Press the space bar on your keyboard to stack the blocks. The goal is to stack each block on top of the previous one, creating a tower.
    
4.  **Time Your Clicks:** Timing is crucial. Click the space bar when the block is directly above the previous one. If you miss the timing and the block falls off the tower, the game is over.
    
5.  **Keep Stacking:** As you successfully stack blocks, the tower will grow taller, and the game will become more challenging.
    
6.  **Achieve High Scores:** Challenge yourself to achieve the highest tower you can. Compete with your friends and see who can stack the highest tower in StackSpace.
    
7.  **Game Over:** If you fail to stack a block properly and it falls off the tower, the game ends. You can then start a new game and try to beat your previous record.
